There are two files for running this program, the first is mk. The mk file needs an argument of some c file (without .c on the end) this will add the command written in the .c file to the bin directory to allow it to be run as an executable in the wanix OS. The r will simply run the OS with any bin commands you've added with mk as well as all other existing commands written into wanix already (that haven't been overwritten).
